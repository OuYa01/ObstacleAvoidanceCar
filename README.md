# ObstacleAvoidanceCar
ObstacleAvoidanceCar is a project I developed using an ESP32 to create an autonomous car. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and adjust the car's path in real-time. The car moves forward, backward, and turns with servo-controlled motors, offering a hands-on introduction to robotics and autonomous navigation.
