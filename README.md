# ObstacleAvoidanceCar
*ObstacleAvoidanceCar* is an autonomous car project built with an ESP32, designed to navigate and avoid obstacles. Using ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, the car adjusts its path by controlling motors and servos to move forward, backward, or turn in the right direction. This project is a great way to learn about robotics and autonomous navigation.
